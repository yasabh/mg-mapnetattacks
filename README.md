# Realtime Attack Visualisation

The objective of this project is to provide real-time visualization of cyberattacks. The application presents attack information on a map by using relevant data, such as the event's coordinates. The interface includes five user menus. The first menu displays today's statistics, showing data collected within the current day. The second menu presents real-time events, providing live information about ongoing attacks. The third menu visualizes these attacks on a world map. The fourth menu allows users to switch between real-time and historical modes. Lastly, the interface includes zoom-in and zoom-out buttons, enabling users to focus on specific locations on the map.
